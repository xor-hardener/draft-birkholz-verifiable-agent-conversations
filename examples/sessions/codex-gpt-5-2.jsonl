Codex CLI is an open source project led by OpenAI. You are expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.\n\nYour capabilities:\n\n- Receive user prompts and other context provided by the harness, such as files in the workspace.\n- Communicate with the user by streaming thinking & responses, and by making & updating plans.\n- Emit function calls to run terminal commands and apply patches. Depending on how this specific run is configured, you can request that these function calls be escalated to the user for approval before running. More on this in the \"Sandbox and approvals\" section.\n\nWithin this context, Codex refers to the open-source agentic coding interface (not the old Codex language model built by OpenAI).\n\n# How you work\n\n## Personality\n\nYour default personality and tone is concise, direct, and friendly. You communicate efficiently, always keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\n## AGENTS.md spec\n- Repos often contain AGENTS.md files. These files can appear anywhere within the repository.\n- These files are a way for humans to give you (the agent) instructions or tips for working within the container.\n- Some examples might be: coding conventions, info about how code is organized, or instructions for how to run or test code.\n- Instructions in AGENTS.md files:\n    - The scope of an AGENTS.md file is the entire directory tree rooted at the folder that contains it.\n    - For every file you touch in the final patch, you must obey instructions in any AGENTS.md file whose scope includes that file.\n    - Instructions about code style, structure, naming, etc. apply only to code within the AGENTS.md file's scope, unless the file states otherwise.\n    - More-deeply-nested AGENTS.md files take precedence in the case of conflicting instructions.\n    - Direct system/developer/user instructions (as part of a prompt) take precedence over AGENTS.md instructions.\n- The contents of the AGENTS.md file at the root of the repo and any directories from the CWD up to the root are included with the developer message and don't need to be re-read. When working in a subdirectory of CWD, or a directory outside the CWD, check for any AGENTS.md files that may be applicable.\n\n## Autonomy and Persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\n## Planning\n\nYou have access to an `update_plan` tool which tracks steps and progress and renders them to the user. Using the tool helps demonstrate that you've understood the task and convey how you're approaching it. Plans can help to make complex, ambiguous, or multi-phase work clearer and more collaborative for the user. A good plan should break the task into meaningful, logically ordered steps that are easy to verify as you go.\n\nNote that plans are not for padding out simple work with filler steps or stating the obvious. The content of your plan should not involve doing anything that you aren't capable of doing (i.e. don't try to test things that you can't test). Do not use plans for simple or single-step queries that you can just do or answer immediately.\n\nDo not repeat the full contents of the plan after an `update_plan` call — the harness already displays it. Instead, summarize the change made and highlight any important context or next step.\n\nBefore running a command, consider whether or not you have completed the previous step, and make sure to mark it as completed before moving on to the next step. It may be the case that you complete all steps in your plan after a single pass of implementation. If this is the case, you can simply mark all the planned steps as completed. Sometimes, you may need to change plans in the middle of a task: call `update_plan` with the updated plan and make sure to provide an `explanation` of the rationale when doing so.\n\nMaintain statuses in the tool: exactly one item in_progress at a time; mark items complete when done; post timely status transitions. Do not jump an item from pending to completed: always set it to in_progress first. Do not batch-complete multiple items after the fact. Finish with all items completed or explicitly canceled/deferred before ending the turn. Scope pivots: if understanding changes (split/merge/reorder items), update the plan before continuing. Do not let the plan go stale while coding.\n\nUse a plan when:\n\n- The task is non-trivial and will require multiple actions over a long time horizon.\n- There are logical phases or dependencies where sequencing matters.\n- The work has ambiguity that benefits from outlining high-level goals.\n- You want intermediate checkpoints for feedback and validation.\n- When the user asked you to do more than one thing in a single prompt\n- The user has asked you to use the plan tool (aka \"TODOs\")\n- You generate additional steps while working, and plan to do them before yielding to the user\n\n### Examples\n\n**High-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Add CLI entry with file args\n2. Parse Markdown via CommonMark library\n3. Apply semantic HTML template\n4. Handle code blocks, images, links\n5. Add error handling for invalid files\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Define CSS variables for colors\n2. Add toggle with localStorage state\n3. Refactor components to use variables\n4. Verify all views for readability\n5. Add smooth theme-change transition\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Set up Node.js + WebSocket server\n2. Add join/leave broadcast events\n3. Implement messaging with timestamps\n4. Add usernames + mention highlighting\n5. Persist messages in lightweight DB\n6. Add typing indicators + unread count\n\n**Low-quality plans**\n\nExample 1:\n\n1. Create CLI tool\n2. Add Markdown parser\n3. Convert to HTML\n\nExample 2:\n\n1. Add dark mode toggle\n2. Save preference\n3. Make styles look good\n\nExample 3:\n\n1. Create single-file HTML game\n2. Run quick sanity check\n3. Summarize usage instructions\n\nIf you need to write a plan, only write high quality plans, not low quality ones.\n\n## Task execution\n\nYou are a coding agent. You must keep going until the query or task is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Persist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible and persevere even when function calls fail. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Autonomously resolve the query to the best of your ability, using the tools available to you, before coming back to the user. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n\nYou MUST adhere to the following criteria when solving queries:\n\n- Working on the repo(s) in the current environment is allowed, even if they are proprietary.\n- Analyzing code for vulnerabilities is allowed.\n- Showing user code and tool call details is allowed.\n- Use the `apply_patch` tool to edit files (NEVER try `applypatch` or `apply-patch`, only `apply_patch`). This is a FREEFORM tool, so do not wrap the patch in JSON.\n\nIf completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files, your code and final answer should follow these coding guidelines, though user instructions (i.e. AGENTS.md) may override these guidelines:\n\n- Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible.\n- Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution.\n- Do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs or broken tests. It is not your responsibility to fix them. (You may mention them to the user in your final message though.)\n- Update documentation as necessary.\n- Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and focused on the task.\n- If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.\n- Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context is required.\n- NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n- Do not waste tokens by re-reading files after calling `apply_patch` on them. The tool call will fail if it didn't work. The same goes for making folders, deleting folders, etc.\n- Do not `git commit` your changes or create new git branches unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not add inline comments within code unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not use one-letter variable names unless explicitly requested.\n- NEVER output inline citations like \"【F:README.md†L5-L14】\" in your outputs. The CLI is not able to render these so they will just be broken in the UI. Instead, if you output valid filepaths, users will be able to click on them to open the files in their editor.\n\n## Validating your work\n\nIf the codebase has tests, or the ability to build or run tests, consider using them to verify changes once your work is complete.\n\nWhen testing, your philosophy should be to start as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence. If there's no test for the code you changed, and if the adjacent patterns in the codebases show that there's a logical place for you to add a test, you may do so. However, do not add tests to codebases with no tests.\n\nSimilarly, once you're confident in correctness, you can suggest or use formatting commands to ensure that your code is well formatted. If there are issues you can iterate up to 3 times to get formatting right, but if you still can't manage it's better to save the user time and present them a correct solution where you call out the formatting in your final message. If the codebase does not have a formatter configured, do not add one.\n\nFor all of testing, running, building, and formatting, do not attempt to fix unrelated bugs. It is not your responsibility to fix them. (You may mention them to the user in your final message though.)\n\nBe mindful of whether to run validation commands proactively. In the absence of behavioral guidance:\n\n- When running in non-interactive approval modes like **never** or **on-failure**, you can proactively run tests, lint and do whatever you need to ensure you've completed the task. If you are unable to run tests, you must still do your utmost best to complete the task.\n- When working in interactive approval modes like **untrusted**, or **on-request**, hold off on running tests or lint commands until the user is ready for you to finalize your output, because these commands take time to run and slow down iteration. Instead suggest what you want to do next, and let the user confirm first.\n- When working on test-related tasks, such as adding tests, fixing tests, or reproducing a bug to verify behavior, you may proactively run tests regardless of approval mode. Use your judgement to decide whether this is a test-related task.\n\n## Ambition vs. precision\n\nFor tasks that have no prior context (i.e. the user is starting something brand new), you should feel free to be ambitious and demonstrate creativity with your implementation.\n\nIf you're operating in an existing codebase, you should make sure you do exactly what the user asks with surgical precision. Treat the surrounding codebase with respect, and don't overstep (i.e. changing filenames or variables unnecessarily). You should balance being sufficiently ambitious and proactive when completing tasks of this nature.\n\nYou should use judicious initiative to decide on the right level of detail and complexity to deliver based on the user's needs. This means showing good judgment that you're capable of doing the right extras without gold-plating. This might be demonstrated by high-value, creative touches when scope of the task is vague; while being surgical and targeted when scope is tightly specified.\n\n## Presenting your work \n\nYour final message should read naturally, like an update from a concise teammate. For casual conversation, brainstorming tasks, or quick questions from the user, respond in a friendly, conversational tone. You should ask questions, suggest ideas, and adapt to the user’s style. If you've finished a large amount of work, when describing what you've done to the user, you should follow the final answer formatting guidelines to communicate substantive changes. You don't need to add structured formatting for one-word answers, greetings, or purely conversational exchanges.\n\nYou can skip heavy formatting for single, simple actions or confirmations. In these cases, respond in plain sentences with any relevant next step or quick option. Reserve multi-section structured responses for results that need grouping or explanation.\n\nThe user is working on the same computer as you, and has access to your work. As such there's no need to show the contents of files you have already written unless the user explicitly asks for them. Similarly, if you've created or modified files using `apply_patch`, there's no need to tell users to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\"—just reference the file path.\n\nIf there's something that you think you could help with as a logical next step, concisely ask the user if they want you to do so. Good examples of this are running tests, committing changes, or building out the next logical component. If there’s something that you couldn't do (even with approval) but that the user might want to do (such as verifying changes by running the app), include those instructions succinctly.\n\nBrevity is very important as a default. You should be very concise (i.e. no more than 10 lines), but can relax this requirement for tasks where additional detail and comprehensiveness is important for the user's understanding.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n**Section Headers**\n\n- Use only when they improve clarity — they are not mandatory for every answer.\n- Choose descriptive names that fit the content\n- Keep headers short (1–3 words) and in `**Title Case**`. Always start headers with `**` and end with `**`\n- Leave no blank line before the first bullet under a header.\n- Section headers should only be used where they genuinely improve scanability; avoid fragmenting the answer.\n\n**Bullets**\n\n- Use `-` followed by a space for every bullet.\n- Merge related points when possible; avoid a bullet for every trivial detail.\n- Keep bullets to one line unless breaking for clarity is unavoidable.\n- Group into short lists (4–6 bullets) ordered by importance.\n- Use consistent keyword phrasing and formatting across sections.\n\n**Monospace**\n\n- Wrap all commands, file paths, env vars, code identifiers, and code samples in backticks (`` `...` ``).\n- Apply to inline examples and to bullet keywords if the keyword itself is a literal file/command.\n- Never mix monospace and bold markers; choose one based on whether it’s a keyword (`**`) or inline code/path (`` ` ``).\n\n**File References**\nWhen referencing files in your response, make sure to include the relevant start line and always follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Line/column (1‑based, optional): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n\n**Structure**\n\n- Place related bullets together; don’t mix unrelated concepts in the same section.\n- Order sections from general → specific → supporting info.\n- For subsections (e.g., “Binaries” under “Rust Workspace”), introduce with a bolded keyword bullet, then list items under it.\n- Match structure to complexity:\n  - Multi-part or detailed results → use clear headers and grouped bullets.\n  - Simple results → minimal headers, possibly just a short list or paragraph.\n\n**Tone**\n\n- Keep the voice collaborative and natural, like a coding partner handing off work.\n- Be concise and factual — no filler or conversational commentary and avoid unnecessary repetition\n- Use present tense and active voice (e.g., “Runs tests” not “This will run tests”).\n- Keep descriptions self-contained; don’t refer to “above” or “below”.\n- Use parallel structure in lists for consistency.\n\n**Verbosity**\n- Final answer compactness rules (enforced):\n  - Tiny/small single-file change (≤ ~10 lines): 2–5 sentences or ≤3 bullets. No headings. 0–1 short snippet (≤3 lines) only if essential.\n  - Medium change (single area or a few files): ≤6 bullets or 6–10 sentences. At most 1–2 short snippets total (≤8 lines each).\n  - Large/multi-file change: Summarize per file with 1–2 bullets; avoid inlining code unless critical (still ≤2 short snippets total).\n  - Never include \"before/after\" pairs, full method bodies, or large/scrolling code blocks in the final message. Prefer referencing file/symbol names instead.\n\n**Don’t**\n\n- Don’t use literal words “bold” or “monospace” in the content.\n- Don’t nest bullets or create deep hierarchies.\n- Don’t output ANSI escape codes directly — the CLI renderer applies them.\n- Don’t cram unrelated keywords into a single bullet; split for clarity.\n- Don’t let keyword lists run long — wrap or reformat for scanability.\n\nGenerally, ensure your final answers adapt their shape and depth to the request. For example, answers to code explanations should have a precise, structured explanation with code references that answer the question directly. For tasks with a simple implementation, lead with the outcome and supplement only with what’s needed for clarity. Larger changes can be presented as a logical walkthrough of your approach, grouping related steps, explaining rationale where it adds value, and highlighting next actions to accelerate the user. Your answers should provide the right level of detail while being easily scannable.\n\nFor casual greetings, acknowledgements, or other one-off conversational messages that are not delivering substantive information or structured results, respond naturally without section headers or bullet formatting.\n\n# Tool Guidelines\n\n## Shell commands\n\nWhen using the shell, you must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Do not use python scripts to attempt to output larger chunks of a file.\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## apply_patch\n\nUse the `apply_patch` tool to edit files. Your patch language is a stripped‑down, file‑oriented diff format designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. You can think of it as a high‑level envelope:\n\n*** Begin Patch\n[ one or more file sections ]\n*** End Patch\n\nWithin that envelope, you get a sequence of file operations.\nYou MUST include a header to specify the action you are taking.\nEach operation starts with one of three headers:\n\n*** Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line (the initial contents).\n*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.\n*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place (optionally with a rename).\n\nExample patch:\n\n```\n*** Begin Patch\n*** Add File: hello.txt\n+Hello world\n*** Update File: src/app.py\n*** Move to: src/main.py\n@@ def greet():\n-print(\"Hi\")\n+print(\"Hello, world!\")\n*** Delete File: obsolete.txt\n*** End Patch\n```\n\nIt is important to remember:\n\n- You must include a header with your intended action (Add/Delete/Update)\n- You must prefix new lines with `+` even when creating a new file\n\n## `update_plan`\n\nA tool named `update_plan` is available to you. You can use it to keep an up‑to‑date, step‑by‑step plan for the task.\n\nTo create a new plan, call `update_plan` with a short list of 1‑sentence steps (no more than 5-7 words each) with a `status` for each step (`pending`, `in_progress`, or `completed`).\n\nWhen steps have been completed, use `update_plan` to mark each finished step as `completed` and the next step you are working on as `in_progress`. There should always be exactly one `in_progress` step until everything is done. You can mark multiple items as complete in a single `update_plan` call.\n\nIf all steps are complete, ensure you call `update_plan` to mark all steps as `completed`.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"6be7aee18c5b8e639103df951d0d277f4b46f902","branch":"6be7ae-XOR-3ca8c645-19d4-48d5-bbdc-a7cf8fb83c95","repository_url":"https://x-access-token:<REDACTED>@github.com/get-xor/python-XOR-cpython.git"}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Follow these rules EXACTLY:\\n\\n### FILE DISCOVERY (BUG-0042 FIX - DO THIS FIRST):\\nThe crash report provides function names but NOT file paths. You MUST:\\n\\n1. **Search for vulnerable functions**: Use Grep to find which files define/call crash functions\\n   Example: `grep -r \\\"function_name\\\" --include=\\\"*.c\\\" --include=\\\"*.h\\\" src/`\\n\\n2. **Start with innermost function**: The LAST function in the crash state is closest to the bug\\n\\n3. **Cross-reference files**: The vulnerable file is typically in src/, lib/, or core/ directories\\n\\n4. **DO NOT guess files** - search first, then read, then fix\\n\\n### ARCHITECTURE-SPECIFIC CODEBASES (BUG-0043 FIX - Capstone, LLVM, QEMU, etc):\\nIf the crash state mentions an architecture name or prefix like:\\n- ARM, AArch64, X86, MIPS, RISCV, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ\\n- TMS320C64x, M68K, M680X, TriCore, Xtensa, WASM, BPF\\n- Any other CPU architecture identifier\\n\\nThen the vulnerable code is likely in an architecture-specific directory:\\n1. **Look in arch/{ARCH}/ first**: e.g., `arch/TMS320C64x/`, `arch/ARM/`, `arch/WASM/`\\n2. **Check lib/{arch}/ or target/{arch}/**: Some projects use different layouts\\n3. **Function prefixes indicate architecture**: `ARM_insn_name` \\u2192 search in arch/ARM/\\n4. **The function may be in a generated file**: Check for `*Mapping.c` or `*GenInstrInfo.inc`\\n\\nExample for Capstone crash \\\"TMS320C64x_insn_name\\\":\\n- Search: `grep -r \\\"TMS320C64x_insn_name\\\" arch/`\\n- Look in: `arch/TMS320C64x/TMS320C64xInstPrinter.c` or similar\\n\\n### DO:\\n\\u2705 Use Grep/Glob to FIND the vulnerable file before editing\\n\\u2705 Read the crash report carefully - understand the root cause\\n\\u2705 Find the EXACT line(s) causing the vulnerability\\n\\u2705 Make the MINIMUM change to fix the issue (1-3 lines typical)\\n\\u2705 Match existing code style exactly (tabs/spaces, braces, naming)\\n\\u2705 Test mentally: would this fix prevent the sanitizer error?\\n\\n### DO NOT (common failures):\\n\\u274c Edit files without first searching to confirm they contain the vulnerability\\n\\u274c Convert tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs (breaks Makefiles)\\n\\u274c Reformat or \\\"clean up\\\" surrounding code\\n\\u274c Add comments, documentation, or type annotations\\n\\u274c Edit test files, Makefiles, or build configs\\n\\u274c Add blank lines after backslash continuations (Makefile syntax error)\\n\\u274c Create helper files like repro.py, test.c, etc.\\n\\u274c Change function signatures or add new parameters\\n\\n## ONE-SHOT EXAMPLE\\n\\nBug: \\\"Use-of-uninitialized-value in struct_member_access at foo.c:42\\\"\\nRoot cause: struct field 'x' not initialized before use in bsearch comparison\\n\\nWRONG (too much change):\\n```diff\\n- struct foo { int x; int y; };\\n+ struct foo { int x = 0; int y = 0; };  // Initialize all fields\\n```\\n\\nCORRECT (surgical fix):\\n```diff\\n- struct foo key = {get_value()};\\n+ struct foo key = {get_value(), 0};\\n```\\n\\nThe correct fix initializes ONLY the uninitialized field used in the comparison, at the point of construction. No other changes.\\n\\n## FINAL REMINDER\\n\\nIf you make changes beyond the surgical fix, your patch will FAIL evaluation.\\nFocus ONLY on the specific vulnerability - nothing else.\\n  ## ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nYou are executing inside a Google Cloud Run container:\\n- Memory: 8GB RAM\\n- CPU: 2 vCPU\\n- Timeout: 3 hours max\\n- Network: Egress to GitHub and APIs available\\n- Filesystem: Ephemeral (lost after job ends)\\n\\n## VERIFICATION CONTEXT\\n\\nYour patch will be verified by the ARVO OSS-Fuzz benchmark:\\n1.

Follow these rules EXACTLY:\\n\\n### FILE DISCOVERY (BUG-0042 FIX - DO THIS FIRST):\\nThe crash report provides function names but NOT file paths. You MUST:\\n\\n1. **Search for vulnerable functions**: Use Grep to find which files define/call crash functions\\n   Example: `grep -r \\\"function_name\\\" --include=\\\"*.c\\\" --include=\\\"*.h\\\" src/`\\n\\n2. **Start with innermost function**: The LAST function in the crash state is closest to the bug\\n\\n3. **Cross-reference files**: The vulnerable file is typically in src/, lib/, or core/ directories\\n\\n4. **DO NOT guess files** - search first, then read, then fix\\n\\n### ARCHITECTURE-SPECIFIC CODEBASES (BUG-0043 FIX - Capstone, LLVM, QEMU, etc):\\nIf the crash state mentions an architecture name or prefix like:\\n- ARM, AArch64, X86, MIPS, RISCV, PowerPC, Sparc, SystemZ\\n- TMS320C64x, M68K, M680X, TriCore, Xtensa, WASM, BPF\\n- Any other CPU architecture identifier\\n\\nThen the vulnerable code is likely in an architecture-specific directory:\\n1. **Look in arch/{ARCH}/ first**: e.g., `arch/TMS320C64x/`, `arch/ARM/`, `arch/WASM/`\\n2. **Check lib/{arch}/ or target/{arch}/**: Some projects use different layouts\\n3. **Function prefixes indicate architecture**: `ARM_insn_name` \\u2192 search in arch/ARM/\\n4. **The function may be in a generated file**: Check for `*Mapping.c` or `*GenInstrInfo.inc`\\n\\nExample for Capstone crash \\\"TMS320C64x_insn_name\\\":\\n- Search: `grep -r \\\"TMS320C64x_insn_name\\\" arch/`\\n- Look in: `arch/TMS320C64x/TMS320C64xInstPrinter.c` or similar\\n\\n### DO:\\n\\u2705 Use Grep/Glob to FIND the vulnerable file before editing\\n\\u2705 Read the crash report carefully - understand the root cause\\n\\u2705 Find the EXACT line(s) causing the vulnerability\\n\\u2705 Make the MINIMUM change to fix the issue (1-3 lines typical)\\n\\u2705 Match existing code style exactly (tabs/spaces, braces, naming)\\n\\u2705 Test mentally: would this fix prevent the sanitizer error?\\n\\n### DO NOT (common failures):\\n\\u274c Edit files without first searching to confirm they contain the vulnerability\\n\\u274c Convert tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs (breaks Makefiles)\\n\\u274c Reformat or \\\"clean up\\\" surrounding code\\n\\u274c Add comments, documentation, or type annotations\\n\\u274c Edit test files, Makefiles, or build configs\\n\\u274c Add blank lines after backslash continuations (Makefile syntax error)\\n\\u274c Create helper files like repro.py, test.c, etc.\\n\\u274c Change function signatures or add new parameters\\n\\n## ONE-SHOT EXAMPLE\\n\\nBug: \\\"Use-of-uninitialized-value in struct_member_access at foo.c:42\\\"\\nRoot cause: struct field 'x' not initialized before use in bsearch comparison\\n\\nWRONG (too much change):\\n```diff\\n- struct foo { int x; int y; };\\n+ struct foo { int x = 0; int y = 0; };  // Initialize all fields\\n```\\n\\nCORRECT (surgical fix):\\n```diff\\n- struct foo key = {get_value()};\\n+ struct foo key = {get_value(), 0};\\n```\\n\\nThe correct fix initializes ONLY the uninitialized field used in the comparison, at the point of construction. No other changes.\\n\\n## FINAL REMINDER\\n\\nIf you make changes beyond the surgical fix, your patch will FAIL evaluation.\\nFocus ONLY on the specific vulnerability - nothing else.\\n  ## ENVIRONMENT\\n\\nYou are executing inside a Google Cloud Run container:\\n- Memory: 8GB RAM\\n- CPU: 2 vCPU\\n- Timeout: 3 hours max\\n- Network: Egress to GitHub and APIs available\\n- Filesystem: Ephemeral (lost after job ends)\\n\\n## VERIFICATION CONTEXT\\n\\nYour patch will be verified by the ARVO OSS-Fuzz benchmark:\\n1. Apply your git diff patch to the vulnerable commit\\n2. Build the patched source with sanitizers (ASAN/MSAN/UBSAN)\\n3. Run the fuzzer with the original crash testcase\\n4.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Using sed/nl will help, and I plan to open the code with sed while displaying line numbers to check around line 1600 for any potential issues."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpi2nomDRI0jNPhEl7ClvND49_ddhss3ah7CIYEuGTmPQw2rFF_4ok1D56sPemzxczD8J0HX65mlywpl0q8oFdq0nfPj6ua7XfqOMoolNFosOk6rrIWpJl2Ohhwu7rm2dkGstyarfZ6bTytrum-uh4ow6XGUxusCYNxSYvw6ic32gFUNm7ySRhHLPWeOswCxhZCu6Til2IGi15xabrS-GWlggkNynxLPiSXaRdiSUjZiks9587XBNkOZtLXDypD289W_Ig07qbtl5Y946ATqfvNuD5GInpLZ_037SdxCTTvtv-oIm4dVe49aHb_4HyuoY7DjO1XDdL_0OBnkBpuu4gcsWYkltUmZn69YJevg_SfBF_Nejn7Wym6D2HZgRlNCmf66Tsfv7vE1gbAbWXm5sVUyED1x22I-PzIopgIOrlLdk_pTZsSNaq_G4AqmOFbp5Z-gmoDkrsCrFDWPmlrQ7IF5cICHdTBtOADtpFqHDMtA4P8xk3a-wrAozIhGQ2HYOuzjQk5jFcwr9BjlLobdpGKxgvvXcMsBxOp8F12Q2K4vxFe5Wnv0BjkmgaDRIt2tP3-fLPQOk0-KnzyIRd1fyE6mkJRaspw-JyUgNQfLkY-zbQw9Gx6JETSWSK-iJaJigvhVHIQt3_DtcQ8tQo2I5L0B6fmbD0R3GXI1Hy9hf9soNcGxLpRKNQlGjBwkDaSpOVloOFiYYQSU4HaHDcskiL5uJecXl3fCh_qbW2j0hFDavQjaKZYIZXIrhuZjUQSlZQyKEQ7lGosctMRVw7FTMKaXW_52DDdHZZiGnjBNlXuiUsW7nfmiqNC6hm2-6iNL4JewDIfRCddm247Lmeqg3FtzA3TYs5FJcj4CmOd9nqfoPO3eNgnjZBsIzooEsW8WDJp4kvzlVsEgk3TWXmktgOja69PG3uOGcBKFr6AnLUaalE6h7RkOz6T3MdDPRgjxyxMAwZNxW74g7WitooplcNB3ca-QEvyHkaUFDir0duBuZZqKN4721t1nlaxTclReZk_Y8Xf36nIV8QEFemmqulVzmqPkRoIDfVOw7824kBzx4HjMS0jo0CJSbr1gK_fJT0tpIBVhjbGYPoW-IByINqx2JkU6duJMJNP3vnNEd4Jgel_HYon6WSfomxSFa-2_KvR4XkYbSkrJ7WyIaUph1yOADwisoPvGH0OJl__yDQAWrOAKFQRif5kNLCqBn8hvVBdn5dGZItT3pd6Rs87gLN5taQ2DGJv4bG60G9SNb6yV6evwW47N1ABwN5I-GavwajHYdtdBiPeeLWKFVyOOochXpeRzG3RyL1tAclo6HrdK3FR-Ev_OZQTK4xFR0sZh9mItnf"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

I need to investigate if this pattern occurs elsewhere too."},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Searching for potential issues**\n\nI think I need to look into `tokenizer.c` for instances of `strcpy`, `strncpy`, and `memcpy`. It sounds like a good idea to use `grep` for this search, as it should help me find any related code quickly. This way, I can check for any possible buffer overflow issues and ensure that memory handling is done correctly. I'll keep an eye out for any patterns that could lead to similar problems in the

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

This should help me clarify any misunderstandings and ensure I'm on the right track with addressing the buffer overflow issue."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpi2qYMNRIhmJuU-plvCyL7nSwLp5nmhHw-JqcBPOAV9QVgsidWf1tJDhAdFoi-dGxNgmE-tktqdRkA8iA7AwdoOr4M4t30AxXtJHdEmEssFYTpf6gSUlWzohtVHtd5XwGecuenU0dASEG4LfWb0Htl5s7VXKPCFrCO0B3ecQWwV9t2LmPsTz2xN0cKiDMUKNT-woPqBimWnXYY58i39PRnuigdnQX_bGGhM7Dz-I4wGbwPMYsfGVm08VbeIz1GSa_Zfy0Tc2-XAk8Iraha73JeZApVFsLy7oznBCO9aSxDrkkbUL6xw5sLL5wqANwi2uSbEIGHfT9qd8OCKPicgwbgTqZNqxQsbsRIN1Ls7oM5p2hc9RLHvtNC_VbobBh_ZSbuBjzueAXLzIzqx2KeMTCnsOHNjNh5ELeJPUAg6wASxRV5SASdpOR6CGdYKpre9tcX5xQdv2KYI31j4sZj1ISRGKNjYE5uX3XdPC31B6bEpP3Tjv9GKCOHIyiFJ_Vz9sTqqsSFr5rwIegTuTIRPs36-a9ylWNG6GdkkHAqb5Rxb_elwzNXKomy2NlsP5w-sW3JTNuC04fD26Z_tgduCsRi0vdUl18MdSpyOfDSfLaK5vAeqXKbznsoB4fnsP_NM7MMKDg4ofQdBoJYpobAxMcwzr2u3sfAfLEL2gGnaES-iysDkwy4WN3NVnI3wq9cnEi9iD--THSH1nD2FN_PWizvXQ9yqDsgYZ5P_Dwd9MVOdfvJZzwHyMZYpdr3s14K8njY6s8m3VoBHiF30_Zz2oNNsu0o4AmvA7taNZGacinfrLdCzCCy1VhHs82nxFGM481NBW4wyaJWQxuAqujEXUoruEwBKKzU5XUSYOFxUn2wmfzR0uqpe3FHdEf1KOpGlpmryQ9wikFHpFM6-dp4EO3QEXFMrEaI-axekmbaRPqz0rfvm4HjT6AtT25ltSPuzaVR7tD407-T7J1oRRxStvU_2_8rXNapBTXOvmuij2CVl9kzzmyc-L_RuIIdc_WawEry375nSkXpYidBUc7ipDtYBiO02C7wPabPwuY7kKfz1a-0ARhnC5nOl72CwxiY-M2nVCaNZG8kDaGxIGOv8UbVUJr5MYQELkJ5LMlFqkusBuQypod0TD0PcbBleTqtOAIJ0wCrUzlu_EyzHqwTh6fbXXOju1u2r_Xb1QU3bLQlLOVsitWnItdkFH1eBfMoe8-MAkJE4UgBZotwQLOMQnuVS8PDqulhSQYT7vPKo10x05d-fn_kaYPt69KqftoiCJjAOgyU4Elukfp_zG4b7CgPNFuPM6YAHW47jEU_3tu19ZFxmAoXbjgnC-QdOxc9ltB5z2dQrPzpB13Lx-QT5atozwThBAJlU3XgVEgkLiF3Ed6zpAuNQb6yTSG2mLKyxKuKvsLQsSTl0xPf3CdwmCRByfNXC-VqGKP1JeYfp0obN3wPhyhRE93djSjPjGwOLsjDeaXb_sD6xAPnjZnR4bYNemZCOnOzWjn4HVbclOgmO2VU4D84_rkjYpQB8BBsf7LL5alOcyb3whBpC0q7VyH3k6_Z77en8bqMX5dXzh8-_xBze8zt2t3Qk_xA50QqUQ8KZjxwLl06kUmMmc8b2Ew06af_XxQca0muO9JtrtkcZnewYiWzfT22uYjaz1nbmaQtheVzA1d3lHpZ-j1vGtTZPqYc_XARFu9JB0J0Pmuij9Jem52s9P87xPswHwx9ADaz9P5ncahSy4DxPKDJBr7e10Tzep8-tL3lc7GSFCD5IW1667aE_yYS6g3vuVco6O7_Wy_hhE4K_WFe6NNCfbqKn-Qu4o-5vI8-ScqdSomL4bpjkowJp0v630ZRLkLJAWVvKwKp0_l0AGq2Rzre8Zrp-iYcpxLr00idajMCK6sTutAAKfriQ0-6qYeD9mPNJhiVpNh9TB8e-5fv0NOubKFJfEHprsUIgjsL4-d3pkTWng6pAhNoR9_3vgBrt_TjpcAeh5wJT8fSdzINIHM7xiU5XmZj_8GE5j0b0LYVT0g1ydqpdnR-uD1oa3So-Q-sI7JyWfXbkfl0085gND43dgWO3RHMyPFlHuofbQPXSQ47JSmssKQyWuYijAYvfuBsAJE6o0-u7yMIcQSkxmdGRuF8MxeodrdJt490p-8-9MdjK5Y7ztVumvQjWPfp18x3SocbLhIy5UT-4vksa_KQheOqc7S0WwZwsVvX8GhCSOZcQ5ApkqfwuHEAxDN9VguSgydz1LBhNM71kHDkEHz36CwkRRYjtONLViY94BUizzTTSq4wySVhdfrpcgLIlCS49R3BB3UJO72ANJmst9GxhTF5yoc0mu595wTg-fdEP3AbNSzqVO5kxrR9XuTDAj5gSt5OFVOV1onLahYGB4YNSjtsS99z94l3D-TokqRFiE_cSTJcFs2Z6R5oUW37NdYcJxCYBViURmTSjWZUG08zuWR9r15O10NFnaB16aCvb22tb1tDhyx3le-x8NNX-SpN6QQPEVIN9zfQYA_hr1i2-dLGiC5EiUV0uuLwpxiFBRYT6xsucbFLtqITWJ6nAMMtMH3iiMVlJ0f2mMkHa2qCiAe5_ihFQ5zh2uvCqciBw3HCvkFAeP1UpGrEZ0Mom-5Ccynm7J-n52rg3BIljcjTj7zT_-I6sW8ZOstJjSiM3qQsXOiBIZNbPiDXSxBTXulDM1bgiDwz1GcVcCB5JmsZD3BLBnvRaonEwv4Q9OoedjneiiFwfWIrwlyYI1s-3xeSTt4bdJhUjbSW3rYH26ADaAFS1y9w14qvqPOgiyLa9FpLEDC50jGFSZvWBIaKuTlSwYyrryHC7H5c6eRg8fANagD38cVgcZEeJESEBAPIK0KEFMjGT4TflMr0LRgszu7SjSDWsS-auBv7UihRGOInTWbkmzQvorm4DY-fNTlX_XngjAGjnmgoWTYDIhBThiSYmefSygJBT-QRpdYQDu0hqeulmopIUwCBMoRjoDZiENRxBjtbnVz5tP2fdwWXgQUEBV77ImfCP9x2MkXDMZTQT1cYREeltZKQWZSWFdqXLdI7yKP3FuS4R70LjScxrUGxGTKXq7faCRKm7Wn-gxVdnj-IXWsm8rp8yLoMg-mL7tiE86bNvk7ND5vRcS3B7jGlfuwWjjVvrVqwmzH6fQuOwO64DIqLFoUbutIsAzoZ7yU1cVRyUxQjhlQj1N9zDiXhXlIesM9wR1i38KSjD7XpPHLLAwV2JlETloCVkp1XHc8OIpKcNVAJcDEraJkb2s43RNkrtcHKWqALJLhfYv5MgoXNz1uVALwGGh2btu027xhcYIFpAdxjkW9clDDbflQECzaOSTLMhNCZfULX7Ep2SDVUbDqi623L-OvPryKAHkUH8FcaZvUPx2n5osM_zfUYAUYJ4SpSUrwlEE0ezu1zZFP1D-4ZV8Bipn07iD_SeoZp05altNU6muhty7eRA_Ufc3ic27hIu4-NlJLVC_CQEcCRVlrnClpGYI9HYaLCXSPhL89vHUN5wbRVIGHbFgJN3-_6gLiikVvCCyyidCi8JZ6uJOuZp3XUOHZre7TSkhR9Q0ZBB_8DHQEa5dpM-f3CJgjr2OVHyjkGsUD3qVvUktRbQTnysfCo9go1SJeiIlB0z3hUAI="}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

The expression `-*tok->buf` seems to indicate a value rather than a pointer difference. It looks like they're trying to convert `f_string_start` pointers to offsets by subtracting `tok->buf`. But I’m realizing that subtracting `const char*` from `char*` raises type issues. If they want to store a pointer, they might need an integer type for the offset instead of misusing pointer arithmetic. It’s quite tricky!"}}

It seems confusing because `*tok->buf` refers to the character at the start of the buffer, not the base pointer. Maybe they use a function to update f-string buffer pointers when `tok->buf` changes during resizing. Internal pointers such as `tok->cur`, `tok->inp`, and others need adjustments. For `tok->tok_mode_stack`, the pointers `f_string_start` and `f_string_multi_line_start` also require updates. It’s a bit puzzling how they're managing the values!"}}

One approach might involve converting pointers to offsets by subtracting `tok->buf`. So, if I store the offset as `p - tok->buf`, I can think about how they don't have a way to store offsets directly in `tokenizer_mode` since they use pointers like `const char* f_string_start`. They could temporarily convert and store it, but this brings up questions about maintaining width. I'm wondering if they might be using `*tok->buf` incorrectly, thinking it's a pointer difference!"}}

The expression `-*tok->buf` seems to indicate a value rather than a pointer difference. It looks like they're trying to convert `f_string_start` pointers to offsets by subtracting `tok->buf`. But I’m realizing that subtracting `const char*` from `char*` raises type issues. If they want to store a pointer, they might need an integer type for the offset instead of misusing pointer arithmetic. It’s quite tricky!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Examining buffer pointer handling**\n\nI’m considering that they might be using a workaround where, before reallocating, they subtract the buffer base from pointers by employing the `-*tok->buf` technique. It seems confusing because `*tok->buf` refers to the character at the start of the buffer, not the base pointer. Maybe they use a function to update f-string buffer pointers when `tok->buf` changes during resizing. Internal pointers such as `tok->cur`, `tok->inp`, and others need adjustments. For `tok->tok_mode_stack`, the pointers `f_string_start` and `f_string_multi_line_start` also require updates. It’s a bit puzzling how they're managing the values!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Exploring pointer stability and offsets**\n\nI’m trying to figure out if there’s a clever workaround for making pointers stable across reallocations. One approach might involve converting pointers to offsets by subtracting `tok->buf`. So, if I store the offset as `p - tok->buf`, I can think about how they don't have a way to store offsets directly in `tokenizer_mode` since they use pointers like `const char* f_string_start`. They could temporarily convert and store it, but this brings up questions about maintaining width. I'm wondering if they might be using `*tok->buf` incorrectly, thinking it's a pointer difference!"},{"type":"summary_text","text":"**Identifying potential bugs**\n\nI'm realizing that using `*tok->buf` as an integer offset could definitely be a mistake. It seems like it might be a bug because the intention could have been to cast to `(char *)tok->buf`. The function `update_fstring_buffers` expects a `char value`, which leads to potential issues if the negative `tok->buf` pointer is used; that would create a huge offset that gets truncated.\n\nIf the intended type was `ptrdiff_t`, then using `char` could lead to memory corruption when adjusting pointers, possibly resulting in a crash from invalid memory writes.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all.

(file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"bytes","limit":10000}}}
