1.  Introduction

   The question of whether the recorded output of an autonomous agent
   faithfully represents an agent's actual behavior has found new
   urgency as the number of consequential tasks that are delegated to
   agent increases rapidly.  Autonomous Agents--typically workload
   instances of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on large
   language models (LLM)--interact with other actors by design.  This
   creates an interconnected web of agent interactions and conversations
   that is currently rarely supervised in a systemic manner.  In
   essence, the two main types of actors interacting with autonomous
   agents are humans and machines (e.g., other autonomous agents), or a
   mix of them.  In agentic AI systems, machine actors interact with
   other machine actors.  The number of interaction between machine
   actors grows significantly more than the number of interactions
   between human actors and machine actors.  While the responsible
   parties for agent actions ultimately are humans--whether a natural
   legal entity or an organization--agents act on behalf of humans and
   on behalf of other agents.  To demonstrate due diligence, responsible
   human parties require records of agent behavior to demonstrate policy
   compliant behavior for agents acting under their authority.  These
   increasingly complex interactions between multiple actors that can
   also be triggered by machines (recursively) increase the need to
   understand decision making and the chain of thoughts of autonomous
   agents, retroactively (auditability after the fact).

   The verifiable records of agent conversations that are specified in
   this document provide an essential basis for operators to detect
   divergences between intended and actual agent behavior after the
   interaction has concluded.

   For example:

   *  An agent authorized to read files might invoke tools to modify
      production systems or exfiltrate sensitive data beyond its
      authorization scope.

   *  An agent's visible chain-of-thought output might diverge from the
      reasoning that actually produced its actions.

   *  An agent might deliberately underperform during capability
      evaluations while performing at full capacity during deployment.

   This document defines conversation records representing activities of
   autonomous agents such that long-term preservation of the evidentiary
   value of these records across chains of custody is possible.  The
   first goal is to assure that the recording of an agent conversation
   (a distinct segment of the interaction with an autonomous agent)
   being proffered is the same as the agent conversation that actually
   occurred.  The second goal is to provide a general structure of agent
   conversations that can represent most common types of agent
   conversation frames, is extensible, and allows for future evolution
   of agent conversation complexity and corresponding actor interaction.
   The third goal is to use existing IETF building blocks to present
   believable evidence about how an agent conversation is recorded
   utilizing Evidence generation as laid out in the Remote ATtestation
   ProcedureS architecture [RFC9334].  The fourth goal is to use
   existing IETF building blocks to render conversation records
   auditable after the fact and enable non-repudiation as laid out in
   the Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust architecture
   [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture].  The fifth goal is to enable detection
   of behavioral anomalies in agent interactions, including unauthorized
   tool invocations, inconsistencies between reasoning traces and
   actions, and performance modulation across evaluation and deployment
   contexts, through structured, comparable conversation records.  The
   sixth goal is to enable cross-vendor interoperability by defining a
   common representation for agent conversations that can be translated
   from multiple existing agent implementations with distinct native
   formats.  The seventh goal is to produce records suitable for
   demonstrating compliance with emerging regulatory requirements for AI
   system documentation, traceability, and human oversight.

   Most agent conversations today are represented in "human-readable"
   text formats.  For example, [STD90] is considered to be "human-
   readable" as it can be presented to humans in human-computer-
   interfaces (HCI) via off-the-shelf tools, e.g., pre-installed text
   editors that allow such data to be consumed or modified by humans.
   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR [STD94]) is used as
   the primary representation next to the established representation
   that is JSON.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

2.  Compliance Requirements for AI Agent Conversation Records

   This section identifies the intersection of logging, traceability,
   and record-keeping requirements across major compliance frameworks
   applicable to AI systems.  The verifiable agent conversation format
   defined in this document addresses these requirements by providing a
   standardized, cryptographically verifiable record of AI agent
   interactions.

   The following frameworks were analyzed for their requirements on AI
   agent traceability and session logging:

   discriminates event types: user, assistant, tool-call, tool-result,
   reasoning, system-event.

2.2.5.  REQ-5: Input/Output Recording (AI-Specific)

   AI-specific frameworks require recording of inputs (prompts) and
   outputs (responses).

   conversation records for at least 12 months to satisfy the most
   common requirement threshold.

2.3.  Framework-Specific Requirements

2.3.1.  EU AI Act (High-Risk Systems)

   For AI systems classified as high-risk under Annex III, additional
   requirements apply:

   1.  *Biometric identification systems* (Annex III, 1(a)) require
       logging of:

       *  Precise timestamps for start/end of each usage session

       *  Reference database used during input data validation

       *  Input data leading to matches

       *  Natural persons involved in result verification

   2.  *Log retention*: Minimum 6 months; financial services may require
       longer per sector-specific regulation.

   3.  *Authority access*: Art. 19 requires provision of logs to
       competent authorities upon reasoned request.

2.3.2.  ETSI TS 104 223 Session Logging Requirements

2.3.3.  PCI DSS v4.0 AI-Specific Guidance

   The PCI Security Standards Council has published guidance on AI in
   payment environments:

      "Where possible, logging should be sufficient to audit the prompt
      inputs and reasoning process used by the AI system that led to the
      output provided."

   This specification directly addresses this requirement through:

   *  message-entry (type: "user"): Captures prompt inputs

   *  reasoning-entry: Captures chain-of-thought (where available)

   *  message-entry (type: "assistant"): Captures model outputs

   *  tool-call-entry / tool-result-entry: Captures agentic actions

2.5.  Security Considerations for Compliance

2.5.1.  Log Integrity

   Per PCI DSS 4.0 Req 10.5 and FedRAMP AU-9, logs MUST be protected
   against modification.  Implementations SHOULD:

   1.  Use the signed-agent-record envelope for cryptographic integrity

   2.  Store the content-hash for offline verification

   3.  Implement write-once storage for log archives

2.5.2.  Access Control

   Per FedRAMP AC-3 and ETSI 5.2.2-1, access to logs MUST be controlled:

   1.  Logs containing sensitive prompts or outputs require access
       control

   2.  Reasoning content may contain confidential information

   3.  Authority access (EU AI Act Art. 19) requires audit of log access
       itself

2.5.3.  Data Protection

   Logs may contain personal data subject to GDPR/privacy regulations:

   1.  message-entry.content may contain PII

   2.  tool-entry.output may contain query results with PII

   3.  Retention periods must balance compliance requirements with data
       minimization

2.6.  Normative References for Compliance Bucket (TBD)
