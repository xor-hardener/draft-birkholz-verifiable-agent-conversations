1.  Introduction

   The question of whether the recorded output of an autonomous agent
   faithfully represents an agent's actual behavior has found new
   urgency as the number of consequential tasks that are delegated to
   agent increases rapidly.  Autonomous Agents--typically workload
   instances of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on large
   language models (LLM)--interact with other actors by design.  This
   creates an interconnected web of agent interactions and conversations
   that is currently rarely supervised in a systemic manner.  In
   essence, the two main types of actors interacting with autonomous
   agents are humans and machines (e.g., other autonomous agents), or a
   mix of them.  In agentic AI systems, machine actors interact with
   other machine actors.  The number of interaction between machine
   actors grows significantly more than the number of interactions
   between human actors and machine actors.  While the responsible
   parties for agent actions ultimately are humans--whether a natural
   legal entity or an organization--agents act on behalf of humans and
   on behalf of other agents.  To demonstrate due diligence, responsible
   human parties require records of agent behavior to demonstrate policy
   compliant behavior for agents acting under their authority.  These
   increasingly complex interactions between multiple actors that can
   also be triggered by machines (recursively) increase the need to
   understand decision making and the chain of thoughts of autonomous
   agents, retroactively (auditability after the fact).

   The verifiable records of agent conversations that are specified in
   this document provide an essential basis for operators to detect
   divergences between intended and actual agent behavior after the
   interaction has concluded.

   For example:

   *  An agent authorized to read files might invoke tools to modify
      production systems or exfiltrate sensitive data beyond its
      authorization scope.

   *  An agent's visible chain-of-thought output might diverge from the
      reasoning that actually produced its actions.

   *  An agent might deliberately underperform during capability
      evaluations while performing at full capacity during deployment.

   This document defines conversation records representing activities of
   autonomous agents such that long-term preservation of the evidentiary
   value of these records across chains of custody is possible.  The
   first goal is to assure that the recording of an agent conversation
   (a distinct segment of the interaction with an autonomous agent)
   being proffered is the same as the agent conversation that actually
   occurred.  The second goal is to provide a general structure of agent
   conversations that can represent most common types of agent
   conversation frames, is extensible, and allows for future evolution
   of agent conversation complexity and corresponding actor interaction.
   The third goal is to use existing IETF building blocks to present
   believable evidence about how an agent conversation is recorded
   utilizing Evidence generation as laid out in the Remote ATtestation
   ProcedureS architecture [RFC9334].  The fourth goal is to use
   existing IETF building blocks to render conversation records
   auditable after the fact and enable non-repudiation as laid out in
   the Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust architecture
   [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture].  The fifth goal is to enable detection
   of behavioral anomalies in agent interactions, including unauthorized
   tool invocations, inconsistencies between reasoning traces and
   actions, and performance modulation across evaluation and deployment
   contexts, through structured, comparable conversation records.  The
   sixth goal is to enable cross-vendor interoperability by defining a
   common representation for agent conversations that can be translated
   from multiple existing agent implementations with distinct native
   formats.  The seventh goal is to produce records suitable for
   demonstrating compliance with emerging regulatory requirements for AI
   system documentation, traceability, and human oversight.

   Most agent conversations today are represented in "human-readable"
   text formats.  For example, [STD90] is considered to be "human-
   readable" as it can be presented to humans in human-computer-
   interfaces (HCI) via off-the-shelf tools, e.g., pre-installed text
   editors that allow such data to be consumed or modified by humans.
   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR [STD94]) is used as
   the primary representation next to the established representation
   that is JSON.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] is used to describe the data
   formats.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts
   defined in [RFC9334] and [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture].

   Fields in a verifiable agent record follow two naming conventions.
   Canonical fields defined in the CDDL schema use kebab-case naming
   (e.g., call-id, model-id, token-usage).  Native passthrough fields
   retained from the source agent use the agent's original naming
   convention (e.g., camelCase or snake_case) and are preserved via the
   * tstr => any extensibility mechanism on each map type.  Consumers
   SHOULD process canonical fields for interoperability and MAY ignore
   native passthrough fields.

2.  Compliance Requirements for AI Agent Conversation Records

   This section identifies the intersection of logging, traceability,
   and record-keeping requirements across major compliance frameworks
   applicable to AI systems.  The verifiable agent conversation format
   defined in this document addresses these requirements by providing a
   standardized, cryptographically verifiable record of AI agent
   interactions.

2.3.3.  PCI DSS v4.0 AI-Specific Guidance

   The PCI Security Standards Council has published guidance on AI in
   payment environments:

      "Where possible, logging should be sufficient to audit the prompt
      inputs and reasoning process used by the AI system that led to the
      output provided."

   This specification directly addresses this requirement through:

   *  message-entry (type: "user"): Captures prompt inputs

   *  reasoning-entry: Captures chain-of-thought (where available)

   *  message-entry (type: "assistant"): Captures model outputs

   *  tool-call-entry / tool-result-entry: Captures agentic actions

2.5.  Security Considerations for Compliance

2.5.1.  Log Integrity

   Per PCI DSS 4.0 Req 10.5 and FedRAMP AU-9, logs MUST be protected
   against modification.  Implementations SHOULD:

   1.  Use the signed-agent-record envelope for cryptographic integrity

   2.  Store the content-hash for offline verification

   3.  Implement write-once storage for log archives

2.5.2.  Access Control

   Per FedRAMP AC-3 and ETSI 5.2.2-1, access to logs MUST be controlled:

   1.  Logs containing sensitive prompts or outputs require access
       control

   2.  Reasoning content may contain confidential information

   3.  Authority access (EU AI Act Art. 19) requires audit of log access
       itself

2.5.3.  Data Protection

   Logs may contain personal data subject to GDPR/privacy regulations:

   1.  message-entry.content may contain PII

   2.  tool-result-entry.output may contain query results with PII

   3.  Retention periods must balance compliance requirements with data
       minimization

3.  Data Model Overview

   The verifiable agent conversation format is organized around four
   complementary perspectives on agent activity:

   *Session Trace* captures HOW code was produced -- the full
   chronological conversation between user and agent, including
   messages, tool invocations, reasoning steps, and system events. *File
   Attribution* captures WHAT code was produced -- which files were
   modified and which line ranges were authored by the agent versus the
   human operator. *Environment Context* captures WHERE the agent
   operated -- working directory, version control state, and sandbox
   configuration. *Signing Envelope* provides cryptographic PROOF -- a
   COSE_Sign1 wrapper that delivers integrity protection, non-
   repudiation, and compatibility with transparency log infrastructure
   such as SCITT [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture].

   These perspectives are composed into a single verifiable-agent-record
   root type.  The session trace is required; all other perspectives are
   optional.  The schema is defined in CDDL [RFC8610] and validates both
   JSON [STD90] and CBOR [STD94] serializations.  All map types include
   a * tstr => any extensibility mechanism following the pattern
   established in COSE [STD96], allowing agent implementations to
   preserve native metadata alongside canonical fields without schema
   changes.

4.  The verifiable-agent-record Type

   The verifiable-agent-record is the top-level container for all data
   produced by or about an agent conversation.  It unifies the session
   trace (HOW) and file attribution (WHAT) perspectives into a single
   record.  The root type also carries version metadata for schema
   evolution and an optional reference to the recording tool for
   provenance.

   verifiable-agent-record = {
       version: tstr
       id: tstr
       session: session-trace
       ? created: abstract-timestamp
       ? file-attribution: file-attribution-record
       ? vcs: vcs-context
       ? recording-agent: recording-agent
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the verifiable-agent-record
   map.

   *  *version* (tstr, required): The schema version string following
      semantic versioning (e.g., "3.0.0-draft").  Consumers use this
      field to select the appropriate parser or validation logic.

   *  *id* (tstr, required): A unique identifier for this record,
      typically a UUID v4 or v7.  Distinguishes records when multiple
      are stored or transmitted together.

   *  *session* (session-trace, required): The full conversation trace
      including all entries, tool calls, reasoning steps, and system
      events.  This is the primary content of the record.

   *  *created* (abstract-timestamp, optional): The timestamp when this
      record was generated.  Distinct from session timestamps, which
      record when the conversation occurred.

   *  *file-attribution* (file-attribution-record, optional): Structured
      data about which files were modified and which line ranges were
      written by the agent.  Can be partially derived from the session
      trace by analyzing file-modifying tool calls.

   *  *vcs* (vcs-context, optional): Version control metadata at the
      record level (repository, branch, revision).  Provides
      reproducibility context independent of the session environment.

   *  *recording-agent* (recording-agent, optional): Identifies the tool
      or agent that generated this record, as opposed to the agent that
      conducted the conversation.

5.  Session Types

   This section defines the types that describe a conversation session
   and the agent that conducted it.

5.1.  The session-trace Map

   A session-trace captures the full conversation between a user and an
   autonomous agent.  It contains an ordered array of entries
   representing messages, tool invocations, reasoning steps, and system
   events.  The trace preserves the complete interaction history
   including all native agent metadata, enabling both replay and audit
   of the conversation.

   session-trace = {
       ? format: tstr
       session-id: session-id
       ? session-start: abstract-timestamp
       ? session-end: abstract-timestamp
       agent-meta: agent-meta
       ? environment: environment
       entries: [* entry]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the session-trace map.

   *  *format* (tstr, optional): Classifies the session style, such as
      "interactive" (human-in-the-loop) or "autonomous" (fully
      automated).  Informative only; does not change the structure.

   *  *session-id* (session-id, required): Unique identifier for this
      session.  Different agent implementations use different ID schemes
      (UUID v4, UUID v7, SHA-256 hashes).

   *  *session-start* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When the session
      began.

   *  *session-end* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When the session
      ended.

   *  *agent-meta* (agent-meta, required): Metadata about the agent and
      model that conducted this conversation.  Required because agent
      identification is fundamental to provenance.

   *  *environment* (environment, optional): Execution environment
      context such as working directory and version control state.

   *  *entries* ([* entry], required): The ordered array of conversation
      entries.  This is the core content of the session trace.

5.2.  The agent-meta Map

   The agent-meta type identifies the coding agent and language model
   used during a conversation session.  Agent identification is
   essential for provenance tracking: knowing which model produced which
   output enables auditing, capability assessment, and compliance
   verification.  For multi-model sessions where different entries may
   use different models, the models array lists all models used while
   model-id identifies the primary model.

   agent-meta = {
       model-id: tstr
       model-provider: tstr
       ? models: [* tstr]
       ? cli-name: tstr
       ? cli-version: tstr
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the agent-meta map.

   *  *model-id* (tstr, required): The primary language model
      identifier, using the naming convention of the provider (e.g.,
      "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "gemini-2.0-flash").  Required even
      when the model is unknown.

   *  *model-provider* (tstr, required): The provider of the primary
      model (e.g., "anthropic", "google", "openai").  Together with
      model-id, this uniquely identifies the model.

   *  *models* ([* tstr], optional): List of all model identifiers used
      during the session.  Relevant for multi-model sessions where the
      agent switches between models.

   *  *cli-name* (tstr, optional): The name of the CLI tool or agent
      framework (e.g., "claude-code", "gemini-cli", "codex-cli").

   *  *cli-version* (tstr, optional): The version of the CLI tool.

5.3.  The recording-agent Map

   The recording-agent identifies the tool that generated this
   verifiable agent record, as distinct from the agent that conducted
   the conversation.  For example, the conversation may have been
   conducted by Claude Code, but the record was generated by a separate
   validation tool.  This distinction matters for provenance chains: the
   recording tool's version affects how native data is translated into
   the canonical schema.

   recording-agent = {
       name: tstr
       ? version: tstr
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the recording-agent map.

   *  *name* (tstr, required): The name of the recording tool or agent.

   *  *version* (tstr, optional): The version of the recording tool.

6.  Environment Types

   This section defines the types that capture execution environment
   context for a conversation.

6.1.  The environment Map

   The environment type captures execution context for the conversation:
   where the agent was running, what version control state was active,
   and whether sandboxing was in effect.  This context is important for
   reproducibility and for understanding the scope of file
   modifications.  The working directory in particular is essential for
   resolving relative file paths that appear in tool calls throughout
   the session.

   environment = {
       working-dir: tstr
       ? vcs: vcs-context
       ? sandboxes: [* tstr]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the environment map.

   *  *working-dir* (tstr, required): The primary working directory
      path.  File paths in tool calls are typically relative to this
      directory.

   *  *vcs* (vcs-context, optional): Version control state at the time
      of the session (branch, revision, etc.).

   *  *sandboxes* ([* tstr], optional): Paths to sandbox mount points.
      Some agents run in sandboxed environments where the working
      directory is a temporary mount.

6.2.  The vcs-context Map

   The vcs-context type captures version control metadata for
   reproducibility.  Knowing the exact repository, branch, and commit at
   the time of a conversation enables consumers to reconstruct the
   codebase state and verify file attributions.  This type appears both
   at the environment level (session context) and at the record level
   (record-time context).

   vcs-context = {
       type: tstr
       ? revision: tstr
       ? branch: tstr
       ? repository: tstr
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the vcs-context map.

   *  *type* (tstr, required): The version control system type (e.g.,
      "git", "jj", "hg", "svn").

   *  *revision* (tstr, optional): The commit SHA or change identifier
      at session time.

   *  *branch* (tstr, optional): The active branch name.

   *  *repository* (tstr, optional): The repository URL.

7.  Entry Types

   The schema defines five entry types that represent the discrete
   events within a conversation.  Each type uses a type field as the
   discriminator.  All entry types support optional children for
   hierarchical nesting and * tstr => any for preserving native agent
   fields that do not map to canonical fields.

7.1.  The entry Union

   An entry is the union of all five entry types.  The type field value
   determines which variant applies: "user" or "assistant" for message
   entries, "tool-call" for tool invocations, "tool-result" for tool
   outputs, "reasoning" for chain-of-thought content, and "system-event"
   for lifecycle events.  This union type is used in the entries array
   of session-trace and in the children array of any entry, enabling
   recursive nesting.

   entry = message-entry
         / tool-call-entry
         / tool-result-entry
         / reasoning-entry
         / event-entry

7.2.  The message-entry Map

   A message-entry represents a conversational turn: either human input
   (type: "user") or agent response (type: "assistant").  This is the
   most common entry type, carrying the primary dialogue content of a
   session.  For assistant messages, additional metadata may be present
   including the model that generated the response and token usage
   statistics.  These fields are absent on user messages, which is why
   they are marked optional.

   message-entry = {
       type: "user" / "assistant"
       ? content: any
       ? timestamp: abstract-timestamp
       ? id: entry-id
       ? model-id: tstr
       ? parent-id: entry-id
       ? token-usage: token-usage
       ? children: [* entry]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the message-entry map.

   *  *type* ("user" / "assistant", required): The message direction.
      "user" indicates human or upstream agent input; "assistant"
      indicates the agent's response.

   *  *content* (any, optional): The message body.  The shape varies by
      agent implementation: plain text strings, arrays of typed content
      blocks, or absent when the agent places content exclusively in
      child entries.  The schema intentionally allows any to preserve
      native fidelity.  Consumers SHOULD handle at minimum tstr and [*
      any] (array of content blocks).

   *  *timestamp* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When this message was
      produced.

   *  *id* (entry-id, optional): Unique identifier for this entry within
      the session.  Enables parent-child references.

   *  *model-id* (tstr, optional): The model that generated this
      response.  Present on assistant entries; absent on user entries.

   *  *parent-id* (entry-id, optional): References the parent entry,
      enabling tree-structured conversations and branching support.

   *  *token-usage* (token-usage, optional): Token consumption metrics
      for this response.

   *  *children* ([* entry], optional): Nested entries within this
      message.  Used when the native format embeds tool calls or
      reasoning blocks inside an assistant message.

7.3.  The tool-call-entry Map

   A tool-call-entry represents a tool invocation: which tool was called
   and with what arguments.  Tool calls are central to agent
   conversation records because tool use is the primary mechanism by
   which agents interact with the external environment -- reading files,
   executing commands, searching codebases, and modifying source code.
   Each tool call is correlated with a tool-result-entry via the call-id
   field, forming a request-response pair.

   tool-call-entry = {
       type: "tool-call"
       name: tstr
       input: any
       ? call-id: tstr
       ? timestamp: abstract-timestamp
       ? id: entry-id
       ? children: [* entry]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the tool-call-entry map.

   *  *type* ("tool-call", required): Fixed discriminator value.

   *  *name* (tstr, required): The tool name (e.g., "Bash", "Edit",
      "Read", "apply_patch").  Tool names are preserved from the agent's
      native vocabulary.

   *  *input* (any, required): The arguments passed to the tool,
      preserved in their native structure (typically a JSON object).

   *  *call-id* (tstr, optional): Links this call to its corresponding
      tool-result-entry.  When absent, positional correlation is used.

   *  *timestamp* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When this tool call
      occurred.

   *  *id* (entry-id, optional): Unique identifier for this entry.

   *  *children* ([* entry], optional): Nested entries within this tool
      call.

7.4.  The tool-result-entry Map

   A tool-result-entry represents the output returned by a tool after
   execution.  It is linked to its corresponding tool-call-entry via the
   call-id field.  The result carries the tool's response data and
   optional status metadata indicating success or failure.

   tool-result-entry = {
       type: "tool-result"
       output: any
       ? call-id: tstr
       ? status: tstr
       ? is-error: bool
       ? timestamp: abstract-timestamp
       ? id: entry-id
       ? children: [* entry]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the tool-result-entry map.

   *  *type* ("tool-result", required): Fixed discriminator value.

   *  *output* (any, required): The tool's response, preserved in its
      native structure.

   *  *call-id* (tstr, optional): Links this result to its corresponding
      tool-call-entry.

   *  *status* (tstr, optional): Outcome status of the tool execution,
      such as "success", "error", or "completed".

   *  *is-error* (bool, optional): Boolean error flag, present when the
      tool execution failed.

   *  *timestamp* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When this tool result
      was returned.

   *  *id* (entry-id, optional): Unique identifier for this entry.

   *  *children* ([* entry], optional): Nested entries within this tool
      result.

7.5.  The reasoning-entry Map

   A reasoning-entry captures chain-of-thought, thinking, or internal
   reasoning content from the agent.  Not all agents expose reasoning
   traces; when they do, the content may be plaintext, structured
   blocks, or encrypted.  Reasoning entries are valuable for auditing
   decision-making processes and understanding why an agent took
   particular actions.

   reasoning-entry = {
       type: "reasoning"
       content: any
       ? encrypted: tstr
       ? subject: tstr
       ? timestamp: abstract-timestamp
       ? id: entry-id
       ? children: [* entry]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the reasoning-entry map.

   *  *type* ("reasoning", required): Fixed discriminator value.

   *  *content* (any, required): The reasoning text or structured
      content.  May be an empty string when only encrypted content is
      available.

   *  *encrypted* (tstr, optional): Encrypted reasoning content, used
      when the model provider protects chain-of-thought output.

   *  *subject* (tstr, optional): A topic label for the reasoning block.

   *  *timestamp* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When this reasoning
      was produced.

   *  *id* (entry-id, optional): Unique identifier for this entry.

   *  *children* ([* entry], optional): Nested entries within the
      reasoning block.

7.6.  The event-entry Map

   An event-entry records system lifecycle events that are not part of
   the conversation dialogue but are relevant for understanding the
   session context.  Examples include session start/end markers, token
   usage summaries, permission changes, and configuration events.  These
   events provide the operational metadata that surrounds the
   conversation, enabling analysis of session structure, resource
   consumption, and agent behavior patterns.

   event-entry = {
       type: "system-event"
       event-type: tstr
       ? data: { * tstr => any }
       ? timestamp: abstract-timestamp
       ? id: entry-id
       ? children: [* entry]
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the event-entry map.

   *  *type* ("system-event", required): Fixed discriminator value.

   *  *event-type* (tstr, required): Classifies the event, such as
      "session-start", "session-end", "token-count", or "permission-
      change".  The values are not enumerated in the schema to
      accommodate vendor-specific event types.

   *  *data* ({ * tstr => any }, optional): Event-specific payload.  The
      structure varies by event type.

   *  *timestamp* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When this event
      occurred.

   *  *id* (entry-id, optional): Unique identifier for this entry.

   *  *children* ([* entry], optional): Nested entries within this
      event.

8.  Token Usage

   This section defines the type used to report token consumption
   metrics for model responses.

8.1.  The token-usage Map

   The token-usage type captures token consumption metrics for a model
   response.  Token usage data is essential for cost tracking, quota
   management, and understanding model behavior.  All fields are
   optional because different agent implementations report different
   subsets of token metrics.

   token-usage = {
       ? input: uint
       ? output: uint
       ? cached: uint
       ? reasoning: uint
       ? total: uint
       ? cost: number
       * tstr => any
   }

   The following describes each member of the token-usage map.

   *  *input* (uint, optional): The number of input tokens consumed by
      this response.

   *  *output* (uint, optional): The number of output tokens generated.

   *  *cached* (uint, optional): The number of input tokens served from
      cache rather than reprocessed.

   *  *reasoning* (uint, optional): Tokens consumed by chain-of-thought
      or reasoning computation.

   *  *total* (uint, optional): The total token count.  May differ from
      input + output when reasoning or cached tokens are counted
      separately.

   *  *cost* (number, optional): The monetary cost in US dollars for
      this response.

9.  File Attribution

      NOTE: This section is specified but not yet validated against real
      session data.  Implementation is pending.

   File attribution captures WHAT code was produced: which files were
   modified, which line ranges were changed, and who (human or AI)
   authored them.  This data can exist alongside a session trace,
   providing complementary perspectives, or independently when only the
   attribution is needed.

9.1.  The file-attribution-record Map

   The file-attribution-record is the top-level container for file
   attribution data.  It holds an array of files, each with their
   attributed line ranges and contributor information.

   file-attribution-record = {
       files: [* file]
   }

   The following describes each member of the file-attribution-record
   map.

   *  *files* ([* file], required): Array of files with attributed
      ranges.

9.2.  The file Map

   A file represents a single source file that was modified during a
   conversation.  It groups all conversations that contributed changes
   to this file, enabling multi-session attribution tracking.

   file = {
       path: tstr
       conversations: [* conversation]
   }

   The following describes each member of the file map.

   *  *path* (tstr, required): The file path relative to the repository
      root.

   *  *conversations* ([* conversation], required): The conversations
      that contributed modifications to this file.

9.3.  The conversation Map

   A conversation links a specific session to the line ranges it
   produced in a file.  This enables tracing from a line of code back to
   the conversation that generated it, supporting audit and provenance
   workflows.

   conversation = {
       ? url: tstr .regexp uri-regexp
       ? contributor: contributor
       ranges: [* range]
       ? related: [* resource]
   }

   The following describes each member of the conversation map.

   *  *url* (tstr, optional): A URL pointing to the conversation source
      (e.g., a web UI permalink).  Validated against URI syntax per RFC
      3986.

   *  *contributor* (contributor, optional): The default contributor for
      all ranges in this conversation.  Can be overridden per-range.

   *  *ranges* ([* range], required): The line ranges in the file that
      were produced by this conversation.

   *  *related* ([* resource], optional): External resources related to
      this conversation (e.g., issue trackers, documentation).

9.4.  The range Map

   A range identifies a contiguous block of lines in a file that were
   produced by a specific conversation.  Line numbers are 1-indexed and
   inclusive.  The optional content hash enables position-independent
   tracking: if lines move due to later edits, the hash can re-locate
   the content.

   range = {
       start-line: uint
       end-line: uint
       ? content-hash: tstr
       ? content-hash-alg: tstr
       ? contributor: contributor
   }

   The following describes each member of the range map.

   *  *start-line* (uint, required): The first line of the range
      (1-indexed).

   *  *end-line* (uint, required): The last line of the range
      (1-indexed, inclusive).

   *  *content-hash* (tstr, optional): A hash of the range content for
      position-independent identification.

   *  *content-hash-alg* (tstr, optional): The hash algorithm used
      (default: "sha-256").

   *  *contributor* (contributor, optional): Overrides the conversation-
      level contributor for this specific range.

9.5.  The contributor Map

   A contributor identifies who authored a range of code.  The type
   field distinguishes between human-authored, AI-generated, mixed, and
   unknown authorship.  For AI-generated code, the model-id field
   identifies the specific model, enabling per-model attribution.

   contributor = {
       type: "human" / "ai" / "mixed" / "unknown"
       ? model-id: tstr
   }

   The following describes each member of the contributor map.

   *  *type* ("human" / "ai" / "mixed" / "unknown", required): The
      authorship category.

   *  *model-id* (tstr, optional): The model identifier for AI-authored
      ranges.

9.6.  The resource Map

   A resource represents an external reference related to a
   conversation, such as an issue tracker entry, a pull request, or a
   documentation page.  Resources enable cross-referencing between
   conversation records and the broader development workflow.  The type
   field classifies the resource while the url provides the
   dereferenceable link.

   resource = {
       type: tstr
       url: tstr .regexp uri-regexp
   }

   The following describes each member of the resource map.

   *  *type* (tstr, required): The resource type (e.g., "issue", "pr",
      "documentation").

   *  *url* (tstr, required): The URL of the resource.  Validated
      against URI syntax per RFC 3986.

10.  Signing and Verification

   This section defines the COSE_Sign1 envelope and metadata types that
   provide cryptographic integrity protection for verifiable agent
   records.

10.1.  The signed-agent-record Type

   The signed-agent-record is a COSE_Sign1 envelope ([STD96], CBOR Tag
   18) that wraps a verifiable agent record with a cryptographic
   signature.  Signing provides non-repudiation and tamper evidence,
   satisfying the RATS evidence generation [RFC9334] and SCITT
   auditability [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture] requirements.  The signing
   envelope is independent of schema compliance: a record can be signed
   regardless of whether it conforms to the canonical schema.

   signed-agent-record = #6.18([
       protected: bstr,
       unprotected: {
           ? trace-metadata-key => trace-metadata
       },
       payload: bstr / null,
       signature: bstr
   ])

   trace-metadata-key = 100

   The following describes each element of the signed-agent-record
   COSE_Sign1 array.

   *  *protected* (bstr, required): The serialized protected header
      containing the algorithm identifier and content type.

   *  *unprotected* ({ ? 100 => trace-metadata }, required): The
      unprotected header carrying trace metadata at label 100.  Label
      100 is provisional (private-use range per [STD96] Section 3.1);
      IANA registration is required before RFC publication.

   *  *payload* (bstr / null, required): The serialized record bytes, or
      null for detached payloads.  In detached mode, the payload is
      supplied separately during verification.

   *  *signature* (bstr, required): The cryptographic signature over the
      protected header and payload.

10.2.  The trace-metadata Map

   The trace-metadata type carries summary information about the signed
   record in the COSE_Sign1 unprotected header.  This enables consumers
   to inspect key properties of a signed record (session ID, agent,
   timestamps) without deserializing the full payload.  This is
   particularly useful for indexing and routing in transparency log
   systems such as SCITT [I-D.ietf-scitt-architecture].

   trace-metadata = {
       session-id: session-id
       agent-vendor: tstr
       trace-format: trace-format-id
       timestamp-start: abstract-timestamp
       ? timestamp-end: abstract-timestamp
       ? content-hash: tstr
       ? content-hash-alg: tstr
   }

   trace-format-id = tstr

   The following describes each member of the trace-metadata map.

   *  *session-id* (session-id, required): The session identifier from
      the signed record.

   *  *agent-vendor* (tstr, required): The agent provider name (e.g.,
      "anthropic", "google").

   *  *trace-format* (trace-format-id, required): Identifies the format
      of the signed payload.  The trace-format-id type is tstr; known
      values include "ietf-vac-v3.0" (canonical schema), "claude-jsonl",
      "gemini-json", "codex-jsonl", "opencode-json", and "cursor-jsonl"
      (native formats).

   *  *timestamp-start* (abstract-timestamp, required): When the session
      began.

   *  *timestamp-end* (abstract-timestamp, optional): When the session
      ended.

   *  *content-hash* (tstr, optional): SHA-256 hex digest of the payload
      bytes, enabling integrity checking independent of the COSE
      signature.

   *  *content-hash-alg* (tstr, optional): The hash algorithm used
      (default: "sha-256").

11.  Common Types

   The following types are used throughout the schema as building blocks
   for timestamps, identifiers, and cross-references.

11.1.  The abstract-timestamp Type

   Timestamps appear throughout the schema to record when events
   occurred.  The schema accepts two representations to accommodate the
   diversity of agent implementations: RFC 3339 date-time strings (e.g.,
   "2026-02-10T17:27:14Z") and numeric epoch milliseconds (e.g.,
   1739205834496).  The tstr form is constrained by date-time-regexp
   which enforces RFC 3339 syntax.  New implementations SHOULD use RFC
   3339 strings; consumers MUST accept both forms.

   abstract-timestamp = tstr .regexp date-time-regexp / number

11.2.  The session-id Type

   A session identifier is an opaque string that uniquely identifies a
   conversation session.  Different agent implementations use different
   ID schemes including UUID v4, UUID v7, and SHA-256 hashes.  New
   implementations SHOULD use UUID v7 (RFC 9562) for built-in temporal
   ordering.

   session-id = tstr

11.3.  The entry-id Type

   An entry identifier is a per-entry unique reference within a session.
   Entry IDs enable parent-child linking (via parent-id) and tool call-
   result correlation (via call-id).

   entry-id = tstr

12.  Full CDDL Schema

   The complete CDDL schema for verifiable agent conversations is
   provided below for reference.  The individual type definitions in the
   preceding sections are authoritative; this section collects them into
   a single validatable schema.

13.  Security Considerations

   TODO: This section will address the following topics before
   publication:

   *  Signing threat model and key management for COSE_Sign1 envelopes

   *  Detached payload risks and content-hash integrity verification

   *  No confidentiality guarantee (conversation records are not
      encrypted)

   *  Trust anchor bootstrapping for signature verification

   *  Privacy considerations for conversation content containing PII

14.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: This section will request the following registrations:

   *  CBOR tag for verifiable-agent-record (root type identification)

   *  COSE header label for trace-metadata-key (currently using
      provisional label 100 from the private-use range)
